High concept - brief description of a game

Junk Collector Simulator 2016 is a 2D 8-bit themed top-view game, which let's you live the life of a typical Junk Collector. As such, your main goal is to collect valuable metal, by finding raw materials and decomposing existing objects, which collected in to your handy bag, can be transported to a junkyard (or "base") in exchange for precious gold. All of this is not so easy, because the police and hobos will try to stop you and take your loot from you! Fighting or avoiding them is key in the neverending process of metal collecting. Well. Such is life. A seemably never-ending story of colleting sh** and figthing unfriendly bastards. Who knew?
